### Accessing the Project
### Viewing the Live Site
This project is hosted on Netlify, providing a reliable and real-time view of the deployed application. You can access the live site by clicking on the following link:
- [View Live Site](https://main--asssessment-aldalim.netlify.app)

### Running Locally Using Live Server
For development and testing purposes, you can also run this project locally using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the project folder that contains your files.

2. **Start the Live Server:**
   - Navigate to the `index.html` file in the Explorer pane.
   - Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server".
   - This will launch a local server and open your default web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5500`, or another port if specified.


### Usage

Once the project is running locally, it will automatically load the data from the Table_Input.csv file. The main web page will display two tables:

- **Table 1**: Shows the original data as loaded from the CSV file.
- **Table 2**: Shows calculated results based on specific data points from Table 1.

### Calculations Performed:
- **Alpha**: Sum of values from A5 and A20. 
- **Beta**: Division of the value from A15 by A7.
- **Charlie**: Product of values from A13 and A12.
