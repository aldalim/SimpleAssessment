## Documentation Overview
This README provides a comprehensive guide to the Table Data Processing Project for the Assessment. Here are what I included:
- **Features**: A summary of the project's core functionalities.
- **Technology Stack**: The technologies used to implement the project.
- **Installation and Setup**: Step-by-step instructions to get the project running on your local machine.
- **Usage**: Detailed description of how to use the application and the functionalities it offers.
- **Deployment**: Information about the project's hosting on Netlify and how to access it.


## Features
- **Data Display**: Automatically loads and displays data from a CSV file.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Calculates and displays results based on the CSV data.
- **Responsive Table**: Displays data and results in a responsive format.

## Technology Stack
- HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styles the HTML content.
- JavaScript: Used for dynamic data loading, processing, and DOM manipulation.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name

2. **Open with Live Server**

i. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
ii. Navigate to index.html, right-click and select "Open with Live Server".

3. **Visit Local Site**

The site should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5500/ 

4. **Usage**

Once the project is running locally, it will automatically load the data from the Table_Input.csv file. The main web page will display two tables:

Table 1: Shows the original data as loaded from the CSV file.
Table 2: Shows calculated results based on specific data points from Table 1.

Calculations Performed:
Alpha: Sum of values from A5 and A20. 
Beta: Division of the value from A15 by A7.
Charlie: Product of values from A13 and A12.

5. **Deployment**
This project is hosted using Netlify. You can view the live site here.
